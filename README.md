Images
===========
Site tiles are labeled numerically 1 through 9 in .PNG format with dimensions of 314x314. You may replace these images as long as they are named the same with the appropriate dimensions. Images should have a transparent background for best results.

The background (bg.jpg), transparent tile background (bg-transparent.jpg), and search logo (searchlogo.png) may be replaced as appropriate with whatever customization you are doing.
